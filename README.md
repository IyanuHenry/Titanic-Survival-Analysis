# Titanic-Survival-Analysis
 Analyzing Titanic Survivors

### Project Overview
This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover insights into passenger survival rates. The analysis focuses on key factors such as:
- The overall survival rate.
- Differences in survival based on gender.
- Variations in survival rates across passenger classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
- The impact of family size on survival likelihood.
- Additional influencing factors, including age and boarding location.

 Through this analysis, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the variables that influenced survival outcomes during the Titanic disaster.
