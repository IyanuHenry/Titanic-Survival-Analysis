# Titanic-Survival-Analysis
 Analyzing Titanic Survivors

### Project Overview
This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover insights into passenger survival rates. The analysis focuses on key factors such as:
- The overall survival rate.
- Differences in survival based on gender.
- Variations in survival rates across passenger classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
- The impact of family size on survival likelihood.
- Additional influencing factors, including age and boarding location.

 Through this analysis, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the variables that influenced survival outcomes during the Titanic disaster.

### Data Source
The dataset for this project is the Train dataset from the Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition. 
It provides detailed information about a subset of Titanic passengers, including their survival status (Survived), demographics, and other attributes.
The dataset was sourced from (Kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data]  a platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts.
Only the Train dataset was used in this analysis, focusing on its structured data to derive insights about survival rates across various factors.
